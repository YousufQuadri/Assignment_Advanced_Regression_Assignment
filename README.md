## General Information
introduction : A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
 The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
 For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

What we need to find ? You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of 
the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

what company want to know using your model. a. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house b. 
How well those variables describe the price of a house. Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
MSE value for Ridge is 0.024448793176475275
MSE value for Lasso is 0.024310505985110805 so clearly both are almost same. 
Since Lasso helps in feature reduction (as the coefficient value of some of the features become zero),
Lasso has a better edge over Ridge and should be used as the final model.
